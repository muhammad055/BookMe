Repo for HotelBooking backend API
This repos is serves as the backend API for hotel booking application. It is scalable if in future the hotel needs to open it's branch so it can be easily added there is
a preantId field in the table to cater that branch can be in same city or different. 
For text search right now freetext is being used but Elasticsearch or Redisearch  should be used to make it robust. Unit cases have also been incorporated.
